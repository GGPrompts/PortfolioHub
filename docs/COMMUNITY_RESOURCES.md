### **🛠️ Troubleshooting Questions**

#### **Q8: Why are my commands being blocked?**
**A:** Commands may be blocked for security reasons. Common causes:
- **Dangerous Patterns**: Commands containing `rm -rf`, `sudo`, or shell injection attempts
- **Rate Limiting**: Exceeding command execution limits (default: 60/minute)
- **Path Issues**: Attempting to access restricted directories
- **Invalid Syntax**: Malformed commands or special characters

**Solution**: Check the security logs for specific blocking reasons:
```bash
tail -f logs/security-audit.log
```

#### **Q9: My terminals keep disconnecting. How do I fix this?**
**A:** Terminal disconnections are usually caused by:
- **Network Issues**: Unstable internet connection
- **Timeout Settings**: Terminal idle timeout exceeded
- **Resource Constraints**: System running out of memory
- **Backend Issues**: WebSocket server problems

**Solutions**:
1. Check network stability and firewall settings
2. Adjust timeout settings in configuration
3. Monitor system resources and close unused terminals
4. Restart the backend server if needed

#### **Q10: How do I optimize performance for large projects?**
**A:** Performance optimization strategies:
- **Terminal Limits**: Keep active terminals under 20 for optimal performance
- **Resource Monitoring**: Use `npm run monitor:performance` to track usage
- **Cleanup**: Regularly destroy unused terminal sessions
- **Configuration**: Adjust buffer sizes and timeout settings
- **Hardware**: Consider upgrading RAM for heavy usage

### **🚀 Advanced Usage Questions**

#### **Q11: Can I create custom MCP tools?**
**A:** Yes! The system supports custom MCP tool development:

```javascript
// Example custom tool
export class CustomDeploymentTool {
  static definition = {
    name: "deploy-to-environment",
    description: "Deploy application to specified environment",
    inputSchema: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        environment: { type: "string", enum: ["staging", "production"] },
        version: { type: "string" },
        rollback: { type: "boolean", default: false }
      }
    }
  };

  async execute(params) {
    // Custom deployment logic
    return await this.performDeployment(params);
  }
}
```

Community contributed tools available in our [Extensions Repository](https://github.com/community/extensions).

#### **Q12: How do I set up multi-team collaboration?**
**A:** Multi-team setup involves:
1. **Shared Infrastructure**: Central backend server for all teams
2. **Team Isolation**: Separate workbranches and resource allocation
3. **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions and team boundaries
4. **Monitoring**: Team-specific metrics and usage tracking
