# 📍 CURRENT SESSION STATUS (2025-01-22 Latest)

## 🚀 Where We Are Now

### ✅ COMPLETED TODAY:
1. **Dual-Architecture Documentation**: Updated README.md and CLAUDE.md to clearly explain:
   - 🌐 **Web Version** (localhost:5173): Standalone portfolio with clipboard commands
   - 🔌 **VS Code Extension**: Native integration with direct API execution  
   - 🔗 **Shared Codebase**: Same React components with smart environment detection

2. **Recent Features Documented**:
   - ✅ Project Landing Pages (click offline project titles)
   - ✅ Improved Port Detection (switched from Image to Fetch API)
   - ✅ Iframe Loading Fixes (timeout fallbacks, enhanced CSP)
   - ✅ Status Synchronization (consistent between web/VS Code versions)

3. **Issue Resolution**:
   - ✅ Matrix Cards status indicators now work correctly in both versions
   - ✅ Web version shows Matrix Cards as online (fixed port detection)
   - ❌ **VS Code previews still not working** - identified iframe nesting limitation

### 🔧 CURRENT ISSUE: VS Code Live Previews
**Problem**: VS Code webview iframes can't nest other iframes due to security restrictions
```
VS Code Webview (iframe) → Portfolio React App → Matrix Cards iframe ❌ BLOCKED
```

**Solution In Progress**: Embedded Simple Browser panels instead of nested iframes
- 🟡 **50% Complete**: Implementation started in `portfolioWebviewProvider.ts`
- 📝 **Added Method**: `_createEmbeddedPreview()` with mobile/desktop toggle
- ⏳ **Next**: Wire up the React portfolio to trigger embedded previews

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:

### 1. Complete Embedded Simple Browser Implementation
- [ ] Add message handler for `preview:create` in VS Code extension
- [ ] Update React portfolio to request embedded previews in VS Code context
- [ ] Test embedded preview panels with Matrix Cards

### 2. Test & Polish
- [ ] Verify embedded previews work with mobile/desktop toggle
- [ ] Ensure preview panels close when projects stop
- [ ] Add refresh functionality to embedded previews
