# Claude Development Portfolio - Development Plan

## 🎯 Current Status (January 2025)

### ✅ Project State: VS Code Integration Complete
The portfolio system is **fully functional** with complete dual-architecture support:
- 🌐 **Web Version**: Standalone portfolio at localhost:5173 with clipboard commands
- 🔌 **VS Code Extension**: Native integration with direct API execution
- 🔗 **Shared Codebase**: Same React components with smart environment detection

**Key Achievement**: All major integration work completed successfully. Portfolio provides seamless development experience in both environments.

> 📚 **Historical Features**: See [COMPLETED_FEATURES.md](./COMPLETED_FEATURES.md) for detailed archive of completed work.

## 🚧 Current Issue: VS Code Live Previews

### 🔧 Active Development (50% Complete)
**Problem**: VS Code webview iframes can't nest other iframes due to security restrictions
```
VS Code Webview (iframe) → Portfolio React App → Project iframe ❌ BLOCKED
```

**Solution**: Embedded Simple Browser panels instead of nested iframes
- 🟡 **In Progress**: Implementation in `portfolioWebviewProvider.ts`
- 📝 **Added**: `_createEmbeddedPreview()` method with mobile/desktop toggle
- ⏳ **Next**: Wire up React portfolio to trigger embedded previews

### Immediate Tasks
- [ ] Add `preview:create` message handler in VS Code extension
- [ ] Update React portfolio to request embedded previews in VS Code context  
- [ ] Test embedded preview panels with Matrix Cards project
- [ ] Verify mobile/desktop toggle functionality
- [ ] Add refresh functionality to embedded previews
- [ ] Ensure preview panels close when projects stop
