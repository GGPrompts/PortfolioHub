## Essential Development Guidelines

### Current Status
This is the root directory for all Claude-assisted development projects. The portfolio app serves as a central hub to view, launch, and manage all projects with a clean, professional interface and comprehensive development tools.

**Portfolio Status**: ‚úÖ **VS Code Extension Integration COMPLETED** - See [COMPLETED_FEATURES.md](COMPLETED_FEATURES.md) for details
**Architecture**: Dual-React system (web + VS Code extension) - See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for technical details

## üöÄ Optimized Architecture (January 2025)

**CONTEXT EFFICIENCY ACHIEVED!** The portfolio has been restructured to eliminate Claude context bloat:

### Before (Inefficient):
```
claude-dev-portfolio/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md (loaded ‚úÖ)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ projects/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ggprompts/CLAUDE.md (loaded ‚ùå)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 3d-file-system/CLAUDE.md (loaded ‚ùå)  
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [8+ more projects with CLAUDE.md files]
```

### After (Optimized):
```
D:\ClaudeWindows\
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ claude-dev-portfolio/ (Clean portfolio hub)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md (ONLY this loaded ‚úÖ)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ projects/manifest.json (points to external)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Projects/ (External projects - context isolated)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ggprompts/ (independent)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 3d-file-system/ (independent)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [all projects with isolated contexts]
```

### Benefits Achieved:
- ‚úÖ **Clean Context**: Only portfolio CLAUDE.md loaded at session start
- ‚úÖ **Faster Performance**: Eliminated context processing overhead  
- ‚úÖ **Independent Projects**: Each project maintains its own context
- ‚úÖ **Scalable**: Easy to add new projects without portfolio bloat

  - Current 3D projects: 3D Matrix Cards (port 3005), 3D File System (port 3004)

## Active Development Focus

### Current Projects (External Structure)
All projects are now located in `D:\ClaudeWindows\Projects\` for context isolation:

- **3d-matrix-cards-updated**: Three.js interactive card display with cyberpunk aesthetics (`requires3D: true`)
- **matrix-cards-react**: React cyberpunk card components with dynamic animations  
- **sleak-card-updated**: Modern card system with water effects and responsive design
- **ggprompts**: Main AI prompt platform with advanced features
- **ggprompts-style-guide**: Design system documentation and component library
- **ggprompts-professional**: Work-appropriate replica with corporate-friendly interface
- **3d-file-system**: Advanced 3D file system viewer with terminal interface and FPS controls (`requires3D: true`)
- **testproject**: React test application for portfolio integration testing

### Key Development Commands

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start portfolio hub (runs on port 5173+, auto-assigned by Vite)
npm run dev

# Start all projects in tabbed Windows Terminal (recommended)
.\scripts\start-all-tabbed.ps1

# Create new project
.\scripts\create-project.ps1 -ProjectName "my-new-project" -Description "Project description"
```

**PowerShell Script Options:**
```powershell
# Start all projects
.\scripts\start-all-tabbed.ps1

# Start only portfolio
.\scripts\start-all-tabbed.ps1 -OnlyPortfolio

# Force restart all (stop existing first)
.\scripts\start-all-tabbed.ps1 -Force
```

## Development Workflows

### Matrix Card Notes System Workflow
1. **Default Interface**: DEV NOTES panel opens directly to Matrix Card note editor
2. **Project Selection**: Choose project from dropdown or leave as "General"
3. **Claude Instructions**: Add optional instructions for AI organization (marked with ###)
4. **Note Content**: Write your thoughts in the large letter-sized content area
5. **Save**: Notes automatically saved to to-sort folder with project context
6. **Organization**: Use "Organize Notes" button to generate Claude prompts for batch sorting

### Note Organization System
- **To-Sort Folder**: `D:\ClaudeWindows\claude-dev-portfolio\notes\to-sort\`
- **Automatic Metadata**: Project paths, timestamps, and Claude instructions included
- **Smart Organization**: Generated prompts include project-specific context and file paths
- **Flexible Destinations**: Notes can be moved to dev journals, CLAUDE.md, README, or topic folders

### VS Code Extension Development Workflow
1. **Launch VS Code**: Extension auto-loads with Claude Portfolio icon in activity bar
2. **Access Projects**: Three panels - Projects, Commands, Cheat Sheet
3. **Direct Actions**: 
   - Click project titles ‚Üí Add to workspace or view landing page
   - Right-click projects ‚Üí Start/Stop/Open in browser
   - All commands execute directly in VS Code terminals
4. **Live Previews**: Embedded iframe previews with proper CSP
5. **Integrated Experience**: No clipboard needed - everything runs natively

## Project Management

### Creating New Projects
```powershell
# Create a new project with automatic setup
.\scripts\create-project.ps1 -ProjectName "my-awesome-project" -Description "Description here"

# The script will:
# - Create project directory from template
# - Automatically update manifest.json and portManager.ts
# - Assign available port automatically (from fallback range)
# - Initialize git repository
# - Create development journal
# - Integrate with DEV NOTES system
```

### Port Assignment for New Projects
When adding new projects to `manifest.json`:
1. **Check current port assignments** in the manifest file
2. **Assign next available port** from the series: 3006, 3007, 3008, 3009, 3010, 5174, 5175, 5176, 5177
3. **Update `src/utils/portManager.ts`** to include the new project in `DEFAULT_PORTS`
4. **Test port detection** to ensure no conflicts with existing services

**Example manifest entry:**
```json
{
  "id": "new-project",
  "title": "New Project",
  "localPort": 3006,
  "buildCommand": "npm run dev",
  "path": "new-project"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Port Conflicts**: Use `netstat -ano | findstr :PORT` to check port usage
2. **PowerShell Execution**: Set execution policy with `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`
3. **Git Commands**: Ensure git is installed and accessible from command line

### Port Management Issues
**Problem**: Project showing as "running" when it's not, or incorrect status detection
**Solution**: 
- Check if another service is using the project's assigned port
- Use `netstat -ano | findstr :PORT` to identify process on specific port
- Kill conflicting process: `powershell "Stop-Process -Id PROCESS_ID -Force"`
- Portfolio port (5173) is excluded from project detection to prevent false positives

**Problem**: DEV NOTES system clipboard not working
**Solution**:
- Ensure browser allows clipboard access (HTTPS or localhost required)
- Check browser console for clipboard permission errors
- Try manually copying generated prompts from browser developer tools

### Project Won't Start
```bash
# Check if port is in use
netstat -ano | findstr :3001

# Kill process if needed
taskkill /PID [process-id] /F

# Restart project
cd projects/project-name
npm run dev
```
