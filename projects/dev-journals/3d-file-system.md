# 3D File System Viewer Development Journal

## January 17, 2025
- Added to PortfolioHub
- Configured to run on port 3004
- Project features both worktree branches: terminal-interface and tree-layout

## Project Overview
A revolutionary way to visualize and interact with file systems in 3D space. Built with Next.js and React Three Fiber.

## Key Features
- **Dual Navigation Modes**:
  - Orbital: Click and drag to look around
  - FPS: Tab to enter, WASD movement, crosshair targeting
  
- **Interactive File Cards**:
  - Front: File info (name, size, type, date)
  - Back: Detailed metadata (path, ID, timestamp)
  - Click to flip with smooth animation

- **File Importance System**:
  - Critical (Red glow): CLAUDE.md, .env, config files
  - Important (Blue pulse): README.md, package.json
  - Normal (Gray): Regular files

## Technical Implementation
- React Three Fiber for 3D rendering
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for UI styling
- 60 FPS performance with 100+ files

## Environment Design
- Concrete floor with realistic textures
- Neon border lighting
- Scanning spotlights
- Collision detection boundaries

## Controls
- **Movement**: WASD/Arrow keys
- **Vertical**: Q (down), E (up)
- **Speed**: Hold Shift
- **FPS Toggle**: Tab
- **Interact**: Click on cards

## Performance Optimizations
- Efficient raycasting (50ms intervals)
- Physics-based movement
- LOD system planned for large file sets

## Current Worktrees
1. **terminal-interface**: Terminal-style interaction system
2. **tree-layout**: Alternative tree-based visualization

## TODO
- [ ] Connect to real file system data
- [ ] Implement search and filtering
- [ ] Add file operations (open, rename, delete)
- [ ] User settings panel
- [ ] VR mode support

## Ideas
- Voice commands for navigation
- File content preview on hover
- Collaborative viewing sessions
- Export 3D scenes as images
- Integration with cloud storage

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Smooth card flipping in both navigation modes
- **Solution**: Unified click handler with raycasting

- **Challenge**: Performance with many files
- **Solution**: Frustum culling and planned LOD system

## Code Snippets
```typescript
// File importance detection
const getFileImportance = (fileName: string) => {
  if (CRITICAL_FILES.includes(fileName)) return 'critical';
  if (IMPORTANT_FILES.includes(fileName)) return 'important';
  return 'normal';
};
```
