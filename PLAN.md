    showNotification('VS Code command copied to clipboard')
  }
}
```

### File Explorer Integration
```typescript
// Windows-specific file explorer opening

### 🚀 Revolutionary Concept: 3D Virtual Estate Builder

#### **The Big Vision: Digital Estate Configurator**
Transform the portfolio concept into a **3D Virtual Estate Builder** - like Sims meets VR Chat meets website builder!

**Core Concept**: Users start with a beautiful, pristine white estate (digital home/office) that they can completely customize and populate with interactive content.

#### **Estate Features**:
```
🏡 Pristine White Shell
├── 📐 Customizable room layouts (resize, reshape, add/remove walls)
├── 🪟 Interactive wall surfaces (mount content anywhere)
├── 📺 Media mounting zones (YouTube, Twitch, art, displays)
├── 🎨 Material/texture system (change wall colors, flooring, etc.)
├── 🚪 Portal connections between rooms
├── 🌅 Environment/lighting controls
└── 🪑 Furniture placement system (functional and aesthetic)
```

#### **User Customization Powers**:
- **Wall Mounting**: Drag & drop YouTube videos, Twitch streams, artwork onto any wall surface
- **Room Designer**: Resize rooms, create custom layouts, add specialized spaces
- **Media Integration**: Netflix, Spotify, social feeds as living wall elements
- **Interactive Zones**: Gaming areas, work spaces, chill lounges, presentation rooms
- **Furniture System**: Tables, chairs, floating platforms - all interactive and functional
- **Lighting Design**: Ambient lighting, accent lights, dynamic color schemes

#### **Use Cases**:
- **Personal Spaces**: Digital home/office environments
- **Event Venues**: Virtual conferences, parties, product showcases
- **Business Showrooms**: Interactive product displays and portfolios
- **Gaming Lounges**: Multiplayer hangout spaces with embedded games
- **Learning Environments**: Interactive classrooms and training spaces
- **Creative Studios**: Art galleries, music venues, collaborative workspaces

#### **Technical Implementation**:
```typescript
// Core Architecture
Estate {
  rooms: Room[]                    // Customizable spaces
  walls: InteractiveWall[]         // Content mounting surfaces  
  furniture: PlaceableObject[]     // Interactive furniture
  mediaZones: MediaMount[]         // YouTube, Twitch, etc.
  lighting: EnvironmentSystem     // Ambient and accent lighting
  physics: CollisionSystem        // Realistic interactions
  sharing: CollaborationSystem    // Multi-user support
}

// Interactive Wall System
InteractiveWall {
  mountPoints: MountPoint[]        // Where content can be placed
  material: WallMaterial          // Texture, color, finish
  interactive: boolean            // Touch/click responsiveness
  content: MediaContent[]         // Mounted videos, images, apps
}
```

#### **Development Approach**:
**Phase 1**: Convert current 3D portfolio into basic white estate shell
**Phase 2**: Add wall mounting system for media content
**Phase 3**: Implement room customization and furniture placement
**Phase 4**: Add collaboration features and sharing capabilities
**Phase 5**: Marketplace for components, furniture, and estate templates

#### **Market Potential**:
- **Ready Player One** accessibility for mainstream users
- **Virtual real estate** market integration
- **Remote work** and **digital collaboration** applications
- **Gaming** and **social platform** convergence
- **Web development** revolution through spatial design

This concept transforms the portfolio from a development tool into a **next-generation digital space platform**!

### Success Definition
