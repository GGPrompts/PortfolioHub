# VS Code Integration Error Fixes

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Port Manager Updates (`src/utils/portManager.ts`)
- Replaced `fetch()` with Image loading technique to avoid ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED console errors
- Port checking now happens silently without polluting the console
- The functionality remains the same - just quieter

### 2. VS Code Manager Updates (`src/components/VSCodeManager.tsx`)
- Changed server status checking to use WebSocket first, then Image as fallback
- Removed console.log statements that were adding noise
- Server checking now happens silently in the background

### 3. Project Grid Updates (`src/components/ProjectGrid.tsx`)
- Commented out debug console.log statements
- Can be uncommented when debugging is needed

## What the Errors Were

1. **ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED** - These weren't actual errors, just the port manager checking if projects are running. This is expected behavior when projects aren't running.

2. **404 (Not Found) for favicon.ico** - VS Code Server doesn't serve a favicon, so this was expected.

3. **405 (Method Not Allowed)** - VS Code Server doesn't support HEAD requests, which was being used as a fallback.

## Result

The console should now be much cleaner. The functionality remains exactly the same:
- Port checking still works to detect running projects
- VS Code Server status is still monitored
- All features work as before, just without the console noise

## Testing

1. Refresh your browser with the portfolio running
2. Open the browser console (F12)
3. You should see significantly fewer error messages
4. The VS Code integration and project status checking should still work normally

## Note

The "VS Code Server automation not available" behavior is correct - VS Code's serve-web mode doesn't expose REST APIs for security reasons. The clipboard fallback is the intended behavior.
