- Successfully integrated into PortfolioHub
- Running as iframe-based project

## Project Overview
Three.js-powered 3D card visualization with Matrix rain effects and multiple layout modes.

## Technical Implementation
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- Custom shaders for Matrix rain
- Optimized for 60fps performance

## Layout Modes
1. **Grid**: Classic card grid layout
2. **Sphere**: Cards arranged in a rotating sphere
3. **Helix**: DNA-like spiral arrangement
4. **Table**: Organized table view

## Performance Optimizations
- Frustum culling for off-screen cards
- LOD system for distant cards
- Texture atlasing for card faces
- Efficient particle system for Matrix rain

## Known Issues
- Touch controls need refinement on mobile
- Memory usage spikes with >100 cards
- Safari WebGL performance inconsistent

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] VR mode support
- [ ] Custom card import
- [ ] Animation recording/export
- [ ] Sound effects integration
- [ ] Multiplayer viewing sessions

## Cool Code Snippets
```javascript
// The Matrix rain effect
particles.forEach((p, i) => {
  p.position.y -= p.velocity;
  if (p.position.y < -10) {
    p.position.y = 10;
    p.position.x = Math.random() * 20 - 10;
  }
});
```
